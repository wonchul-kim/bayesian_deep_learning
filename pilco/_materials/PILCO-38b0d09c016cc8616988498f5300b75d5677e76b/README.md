# Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control

A modern \& clean implementation of the [PILCO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6654139/) Algorithm in `TensorFlow`.

Unlike PILCO's [original implementation](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/) which was written as a self-contained package of `MATLAB`, this repository aims to provide a clean implementation by heavy use of modern machine learning libraries.

In particular, we use `TensorFlow` to avoid the need for hardcoded gradients and scale to GPU architectures. Moreover, we use [`GPflow`](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) for Gaussian Process Regression.

The core functionality is tested against the original `MATLAB` implementation.

## Example of usage
First install the package by running:
```
python setup.py develop
```

Then you can run the example of using PILCO in [`OpenAI gym`](https://gym.openai.com) by running
```
python examples/inverted_pendulum.py
```
